# diff

This is a simple implementation of a diff program based on the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm, implemented using Dynamic Programming. The main goal of this implementation is to support teaching Diff in a Software Configuration Management class.

It allows choosing the granularity among lines, words, or characters.
